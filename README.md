In this project I will be recreating the game of tic tac toe.  Players will be able to enter their names before starting the game.  Upon player selections, the player will be informed of who's turn it is to play.  Once a player completes 3 of their symbols in a row they will be declared and displayed the winner.  If not the display will render a tie.  Player's will be able to restart the game if they choose.  I will attempt to complete this project utilizing as few global variables as possible and instead leverage factory functions and the modular pattern.
